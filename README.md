## NTLM with Apache HTTP Components 5.1

This project contains a simple example on how to access API protected with 
the legacy Windows NTLM protocol using newer incarnations of the Apache HTTP 
Components library.

You might want to provide API access details in `Ntlm.java` and edit the 
logging configuration under `src/main/java/log4j2.xml` before executing the code.
